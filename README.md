# OpenFOAM case study: Ahmed Body

This repo documents my experience with learning OpenFOAM, and is based on the repo https://github.com/nathanrooy/ahmed-bluff-body-cfd. 
The Ahmed body geometry is included so anyone can use it in their simulations. However, if you would like to add a validation case, you can still open a pull request and I'll add it!

This repo will primarily be evaluating the characteristics and performance of different solvers. Results from the evaluation will be stored in the [results](results) folder as GIFs. If you want the full simulation, you can run the included scripts.

## Background

OpenFOAM is an open-source CFD package, which offers a high degree of customizability. If you are unfamiliar with it, it is highly recommended to follow the [tutorials](https://cfd.direct/openfoam/documentation/) and [youtube guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMoFaZcPifM&list=PLvkU6i2iQ2fobFabvgRFeCGsHOqJ8iB5W&index=1)

## Results
